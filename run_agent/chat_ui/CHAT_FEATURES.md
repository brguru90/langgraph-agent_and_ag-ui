# reference to working console implementaion,
run_agent/main.js(read only, not allowed to update file)
this is how its implemented in main.js and its a tested solution, please try to use same approach or trust it as reference
1. runAgent called to intiate the conversation and pushes first user message
2. then calls runWithInterruptHandling with run_id and resume false
3. then message streaming begins, for each type of stream there is a callback in agent.runAgent,
example to collect text chunks, `onTextMessageContentEvent` we get the text in parameter_object.event.delta and we can consider it as type assistant
4. during the streaming, we might get interruption custom event(on_interrupt), which allow human in loop between conversation, which will take the user input before resuming(example prompt looks like "Tool call exceeded limit, please reply:\n 1. 'yes' to continue\n 2. 'no' to exit\n 3. any other input will be treated as feedback prompt")
5. once entered to interrupt session, straming will continue on the interrupted session and phaused on original session(it can recursivery enter multiple interrupt session)
6. once the interrupt treaming finishes, it will return back to originating session & mostly nothing left on original session, then it completes
7. if the conversation complete and entire session closes, but we want to resume it from history, then conversation can be resumed by thread_id and same process from the beggining repeats
8. for both resuming interrupt and resume conversation we might need to restore message before starting
